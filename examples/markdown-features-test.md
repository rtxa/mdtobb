## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>> ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.

## Lists

**Unordered**

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

**Ordered**

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

**Checkbox**

- [x] Some checked item
  - [x] Some checked subitem
  - [ ] Some unchecked subitem
- [ ] Some unchecked item
- [x] Another checked item

**Stylized list**

1. ### This is some text  
   Bla bla bla, bla bla...
   * Now this is another item
   * Other item

## Code

Here is some `inline code`. There are some things we don't `control`.

**Indented code**

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code


Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```
